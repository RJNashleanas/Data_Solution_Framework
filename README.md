# Data_Integration_Framework
Architecture and patterns for Data Integration. Working on collaboratively maintaining architecture patterns.

The pattern structure (Design and Solution Pattern layout) always is as follows:

* <title>, the name of the patterns
* Purpose, a short statement what the pattern is trying to achieve or explain. What is the intent?
* Motivation, a short overview of the background and relevance of the pattern. Why is there a need?
* Applicability, a listing of where this pattern can be expected to play a role.
* Structure, the main section with the pattern details.
* Implementation Guidelines, any references to how to implement this pattern (Design Patterns only). Note that the Solution Pattern is intended to explain the specifics in a technical context. This is meant to capture any generic topics.  
* Considerations and consequences, meant to offer some alternative views and experiences as to what it means to take a certain decision.
* Related Patterns, any references towards futher reading and related content.

the <title> is in Header 1 format, the sections are in Header 2 format.
