# Data Integration Framework
Standards for Data Integration architecture and patterns, to enable working on collaboratively maintaining the pattern body of knowledge.

The pattern structure (Design and Solution Pattern layout) always is as follows:

* **Title**, the name of the pattern
* **Purpose**, a short statement what the pattern is trying to achieve or explain. What is the intent?
* **Motivation**, a short overview of the background and relevance of the pattern. Why is there a need?
* **Applicability**, a listing of where this pattern can be expected to play a role.
* **Structure**, the main section with the pattern details.
* I**mplementation guidelines**, any references to how to implement this pattern (Design Patterns only). Note that the Solution Pattern is intended to explain the specifics in a technical context. This is meant to capture any generic topics.  
* **Considerations and consequences**, meant to offer some alternative views and experiences as to what it means to take a certain decision.
* **Related patterns**, any references towards further reading and related content.

The Title is in Header 1 format, the sections are in Header 2 format.
